## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the standard Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. You may be required to download the 'punkt' module of nltk. This has been commented out in the first cell of the notebook.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I wanted to understand the activity on the reddit group WallStreetBets:

1. How is the activity on the group in 2021 compared to the previous years?
2. At what point in time did the increase in activity occur?
3. Were there any influential redditors who were vital to the increased activity?
4. What were the most common phrases that were used in posts?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All of the analysis is done in the jupyter notebook.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for the individual steps.  

The csv file that serves as the data for this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/reddit-rwallstreetbets).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://raju-vishnu.medium.com/r-wallstreetbets-the-subreddit-that-annoyed-the-hedge-funds-ee7f61871bc7).
